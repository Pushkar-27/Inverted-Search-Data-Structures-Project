📌 Inverted Search – Data Structure Project

Happy to share my Inverted Search Project, developed during my training at Emertxe Information Technologies, Bangalore.

📚 Built an Inverted Search Engine in C that processes multiple text files and creates a reverse index (word-to-file mapping) using Hash Tables and Linked Lists. This enables efficient searching, storage, and modification of data—similar to how search engines and dictionaries work.

💡 Through this project, I learned and implemented:
⿡ Creation of hash tables for efficient data indexing
⿢ File handling, dynamic memory allocation, and modular programming in C
⿣ Designing data structures for optimized search performance

⚙ Tech Stack:
C Programming | Data Structures | File Handling | Hash Tables

🎯 Objective:
To design a fast, structured, and efficient word-search system for multiple text files using hashing concepts.
